The <strong>Acquisitions Status</strong> section presents past, current, and planned Copernicus Sentinel acquisitions on an interactive 3D globe. <strong>Events</strong> provides recent information about activities that may affect data production, such as manoeuvres or anomalies. In <strong>Data Availability</strong>, you'll find real-time access to delivered data collections, including <em>Detail Data Availability</em> and <em>Global Data Availability</em> views. These help users browse and assess products according to their research needs. Finally, the <strong>Processors</strong> tab  features an interactive timeline of Sentinel processor releases, allowing detailed inspection of each version. This timeline works in conjunction with the left-hand panel, where you can filter the data by mission (e.g., Sentinel-2). As you explore the timeline and filtered data, hovering over the graphs reveals tooltips with precise values and timestamps, providing a seamless, detailed view of processor updates."

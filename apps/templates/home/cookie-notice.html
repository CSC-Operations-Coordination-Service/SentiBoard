                                        Matomo is an open source web analytics platform which complies with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 27 April 
                                        2016. This means that Matomo ensures end-user data protection, thanks to features such as source data anonymisation and opt-out mechanisms 
                                        for users.
                                    </p>

                                        Cookies generated by Matomo enable ESA to track information about visitors in an anonymised form. Examples of such information are:

                                            the user's anonymised internet protocol (IP) address. Matomo uses an IP anonymisation mechanism which automatically masks a portion 
                                            of each user's IP, effectively making it impossible to identify a particular visitor from the remaining information.
